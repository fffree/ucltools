This repository contains a number of scripts that I have written to help me with
some common tasks encountered while teaching in the
[Linguistics department](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics) at
[UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). If you also teach at UCL you may find these useful.

Currently there are two scripts in this repository:

1. [`make-class-list`](./make-class-list/) is a Python script that transforms
  the class printout with photos generated by [UCL Portico](https://ucl.ac.uk/portico)
  into a sever lists split by tutorial group allocation and with nicer formatting
  and weekly tick-boxes to track attendance.

  I use this to prepare tutorial rosters for large courses which help me both in
  getting to know students better and which I can also give to TAs to help them
  with managing their tutorials and keeping attendance records where required.

2. [`moodle-attendance-mapper`](./moodle-attendance-mapper/) is an R script which
  parses moodle log files for entries showing students launching either a
  Blackboard Collaborate or Zoom session in a given week and then marking them
  as present in an attendance sheet.

  I use this to semi-automate attendance tracking for online teaching, so we
  don't have to spend class time on this and I can just download the log and
  upload the attendance spreadsheet afterwards.

For more detail on each of these scripts please have a look at the READMEs in
the respective directory for each of the scripts.
